# Summary.

5+ years of hands-on experience Software Engineer. Experienced in all aspects of the software development cycle and end-to-end project management. Repeated tasks can be automated and have experience in building a test and development environment for CI/CD using containers. Through profiling, existing projects that are difficult to detect and test API performance bottlenecks have been improved or improved into structures that are easy to test.
